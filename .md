## Task 1

Created base application structure

## Task 2

Created main view of the app with two sections: History and Launches. Since at the beginning no section is selected I used a placeholder (rocket image) instead of section content.

## Task 3

Created History section. When user clicks on History section the app fetches history information. While information is being fetched a backdrop with loading indicator is displayed.

Once history data is recevied the app renders cards of history event that include title, event date, flight number, details and links to read more information about the event.
