## Task 1

Created base application structure

## Task 2

Created main view of the app with two sections: History and Launches. Since at the beginning no section is selected I used a placeholder (rocket image) instead of section content.

## Task 3

Created History section. When user clicks on History section the app fetches history information. While information is being fetched a backdrop with loading indicator is displayed.

Once history data is received the app renders cards of history event that include title, event date, flight number, details and links to read more information about the event.

## Task 4

Created Launches section. When user clicks on Launches section the app fetches only necessary information to be displayed. While information is being fetched a backdrop with loading indicator is displayed.

Once launches data is received the app renders cards of launch that include mission name, mission date, payload data such as payload's type, manufacturer and nationality.

There's also two input for filtering launches by mission name and mission date.

Once the app fetches data (either history or launches) it stores that data inside app store.

## Task 5

Created Orbit filter item. Due to some inconsistency (or maybe I misunderstood something) between the orbit information  (`payload_weights`) in rocketâ€™s structure received from the Rocket endpoint and information about orbit in launch's structure received from the Launch endpoint I decided to filter launches in the following way: if selected orbit in filter can be reached by a rocket type of a given launch and total rocket's payload weight is less or equal to weight indicated in `payload_weights` then I display that launch to the user.

Went away from usage of internal react state to redux (particularly filter state) + added selectors.
